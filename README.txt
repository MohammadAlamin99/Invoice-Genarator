Ans: 
Suppose you want to rent a car and there are two rates available:

    Daily rental: $50
    Hourly rental: $10 per hour

Now, you want to rent the car for 5 hours. In this case, you have two options:

    Hourly rental:
        5 hours × $10 per hour = $50

    Daily rental:
        For the entire day = $50

Between the two options, you should choose the one that gives you the most benefit for the least cost. Here, both options show the same cost, but there are some advantages to choosing the daily rental:

    Time savings: If you want to use the car for more than 5 hours, the daily rental is more beneficial because you can use the car for the whole day at the same price.
    Flexibility: With a daily rental, you can use the car anytime you want, and if your plans change, it won’t be a problem.

Conclusion:

In this situation, although your initial requirement is for 5 hours, it is wise to choose the daily rental because it allows you to use the car for the entire day at no additional cost.

Therefore, when renting a car for 5 hours, choose the daily rental because you get the benefit of the entire day at the same price.
